# _onlineStore_

#### By _**Anna Carolina**_

#### This online store website project is for demonstration purposes resulting from academic work carried out within the Technician/Specialist in Information Systems Technologies and Programming course. I used a free online template, the point was not work on the styling of the website but working on its functions.

## Description

The store has a back office that can only be accessed by users with an "admin" profile and where users, products and orders can be managed.
The front end presents the products to users and allow them to add them to the shopping cart. When the customer/user completes the order, they'll need to authenticate to complete the process. If they don't have an account yet, they're able to register or recover their password.
Features:
- Showcase of products/services with the ability to sort products/services by product name and price in ascending and descending order
- Shopping cart with the number of products added and the total amount in € (possibility to add and remove products). A user who authenticates and leaves the session with a filled shopping cart, the next time he enters the application and authenticates, should find the shopping cart filled as he left it the last time.
- Possibility to complete the order by sending it in PDF format to the customer's email address
- 2 different types of customers (regular and reseller), where the prices shown to a "reseller" are always 20% lower. The regular price are (crossed out) and the discounted price are displayed.
- Pagination in the "showcase" of products/services
- Search for a product/service by product/service name
- User registration with account activation
- Password change
- Password recovery
- Possibility to send a message - Live chat (example https://foxgeeks.pt/)- Tool https://www.tawk.to/ (I used tawk.to)
